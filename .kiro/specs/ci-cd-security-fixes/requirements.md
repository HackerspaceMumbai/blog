# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Hackerspace Mumbai website is experiencing multiple CI/CD pipeline failures and security vulnerabilities affecting both Netlify deployments and GitHub Actions workflows. The primary issues include: (1) a pnpm lockfile synchronization problem where `sanitize-html@^2.17.0` was added to package.json but pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date, causing frozen lockfile installation failures on Netlify, (2) GitHub Actions test failures in visual regression tests that require a dev server to be running but fail when the server is not available, and (3) a security vulnerability in `src/config/security.js:230` where custom XSS detection patterns use inadequate regular expressions that don't properly match script end tags like `</script >`, creating potential XSS attack vectors. These issues prevent successful deployments, break the continuous integration workflow, and compromise the website's security posture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pnpm lockfile to be synchronized with package.json, so that Netlify deployments succeed without lockfile conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deployment is triggered on Netlify THEN the pnpm install process SHALL complete successfully without frozen lockfile errors
2. WHEN package.json dependencies are modified THEN the pnpm-lock.yaml file SHALL be updated to reflect those changes
3. WHEN the lockfile is regenerated THEN it SHALL maintain the exact same dependency versions for existing packages to avoid breaking changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want clear documentation and processes for dependency management, so that future lockfile sync issues are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers add new dependencies THEN they SHALL update the lockfile using the proper pnpm commands
2. WHEN the project documentation is reviewed THEN it SHALL include clear instructions for dependency management and lockfile maintenance
3. WHEN a lockfile sync issue occurs THEN developers SHALL have a documented recovery process to follow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to handle lockfile issues gracefully, so that deployments are more resilient to dependency management problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lockfile sync issue is detected THEN the deployment process SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery instructions
2. WHEN the Netlify build configuration is reviewed THEN it SHALL include appropriate fallback strategies for lockfile issues
3. WHEN dependency installation fails THEN the build process SHALL attempt recovery using non-frozen lockfile installation if safe to do so

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the sanitize-html dependency is properly integrated, so that the functionality requiring this package works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sanitize-html package is installed THEN it SHALL be available for import in the codebase
2. WHEN the application is built THEN all modules using sanitize-html SHALL compile successfully
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the sanitize-html functionality SHALL work as expected without runtime errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want GitHub Actions visual regression tests to run reliably, so that the CI pipeline doesn't fail due to missing dev server dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visual regression tests run in GitHub Actions THEN they SHALL either have access to a running dev server OR gracefully skip when the server is unavailable
2. WHEN the BlogImageVisualRegression.deployment.test.js runs THEN it SHALL not throw errors about missing dev servers in CI environments
3. WHEN GitHub Actions workflows execute THEN they SHALL complete successfully without test failures related to dev server availability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want GitHub Actions workflows to be resilient to environment differences, so that tests run consistently across local and CI environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests require a dev server THEN they SHALL detect the environment and adapt their behavior accordingly
2. WHEN running in CI environments THEN tests SHALL use appropriate mocking or alternative strategies instead of requiring live servers
3. WHEN GitHub Actions workflows fail THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages that help developers understand and fix the issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want XSS protection to use well-tested sanitization libraries instead of custom regex patterns, so that the website is protected against XSS attacks including edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN XSS detection is performed THEN it SHALL use a well-tested sanitization library like sanitize-html instead of custom regular expressions
2. WHEN the security configuration is reviewed THEN it SHALL not contain vulnerable regex patterns that fail to match script end tags with spaces
3. WHEN XSS protection is implemented THEN it SHALL handle corner cases correctly that custom regex implementations typically miss

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the security configuration to be robust and maintainable, so that security vulnerabilities are not introduced through inadequate pattern matching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security patterns are updated THEN they SHALL be replaced with library-based solutions that are regularly maintained and tested
2. WHEN the sanitize-html library is integrated THEN it SHALL be properly configured to handle the specific XSS protection needs of the application
3. WHEN security tests are run THEN they SHALL verify that XSS protection works correctly against various attack vectors including malformed script tags
