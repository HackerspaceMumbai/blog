# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Investigate and diagnose the current image display issue






  - Debug the BlogCard component to understand why cover images aren't displaying
  - Verify how Astro content collections handle image() schema fields
  - Test the current image fallback logic with actual blog posts
  - Document the root cause of the image display problem
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [x] 2. Fix the BlogCard component image handling







  - Update the image resolution logic to properly handle Astro ImageMetadata objects
  - Implement robust fallback logic for missing or invalid cover images
  - Ensure the placeholder image import and usage works correctly
  - Test the component with posts that have and don't have cover images
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 3. Verify BlogSection component integration






  - Test that the fixed BlogCard component works correctly within BlogSection
  - Ensure all blog posts display their cover images properly in the homepage section
  - Verify the responsive grid layout works with the corrected images
  - Test the featured post badge displays correctly over the cover image
  - _Requirements: 1.3_

- [x] 4. Verify blog index page integration






  - Test that the fixed BlogCard component works correctly in src/pages/blog/index.astro
  - Ensure all blog posts display their cover images properly in the full blog listing
  - Verify the grid layout and responsive behavior with corrected images
  - Test the empty state handling when no posts are available
  - _Requirements: 1.4_

- [x] 5. Create comprehensive automated tests for blog image display






  - Write unit tests for BlogCard component with various image scenarios
  - Create integration tests for BlogSection component image display
  - Create integration tests for blog index page image display
  - Implement visual regression tests to prevent future image display issues
  - Add tests to verify placeholder image fallback functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.3, 3.4_

- [x] 6. Set up blog image testing infrastructure












  - Create test blog posts with various cover image scenarios (valid, missing, invalid)
  - Set up test image assets in multiple formats for comprehensive testing
  - Configure CI/CD pipeline to run blog image tests automatically
  - Create npm script for running blog image tests (`pnpm test:blog-images`)
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 7. Implement monitoring and regression prevention






  - Add pre-commit hooks to run blog image display tests
  - Configure CI/CD to fail builds if blog image tests don't pass
  - Set up automated screenshot comparison tests for visual regression detection
  - Create smoke tests for production deployment verification
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 8. Test with different image formats and edge cases







  - Test blog posts with PNG cover images
  - Test blog posts with JPG cover images
  - Test blog posts with WebP cover images (if supported)
  - Test blog posts with missing image files
  - Test blog posts with invalid image paths in frontmatter
  - Test blog posts without cover field in frontmatter
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 9. Verify Astro image optimization integration






  - Ensure cover images are properly optimized during build process
  - Verify responsive image generation works correctly
  - Test lazy loading functionality with the corrected image handling
  - Confirm proper aspect ratios are maintained across different screen sizes
  - _Requirements: 2.4_

- [x] 10. Documentation and final verification






  - Update component documentation to reflect proper image handling
  - Create developer guidelines for adding new blog posts with cover images
  - Perform final end-to-end testing across all blog display contexts
  - Verify the fix works in both development and production builds
  - Confirm all automated tests pass and are integrated into the main test suite
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_
