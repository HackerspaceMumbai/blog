# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The blog post cover images are not displaying properly in the BlogSection component and the blog index page. Currently, blog posts have cover images defined in their frontmatter (e.g., `cover: ./cover.png`), but these images are not being rendered correctly when the BlogCard component is used within BlogSection.astro and src/pages/blog/index.astro. The images appear as broken or missing, while the placeholder image fallback may or may not be working correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see the correct cover images for blog posts when browsing the blog section on the homepage and the main blog index page, so that I can visually identify and engage with the content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog post has a cover image defined in its frontmatter THEN the BlogCard component SHALL display that cover image correctly
2. WHEN a blog post does not have a cover image defined THEN the BlogCard component SHALL display the placeholder image as fallback
3. WHEN the BlogCard is rendered in BlogSection.astro THEN all cover images SHALL load and display properly
4. WHEN the BlogCard is rendered in src/pages/blog/index.astro THEN all cover images SHALL load and display properly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the image loading system to be robust and handle different image formats and paths correctly, so that the blog display is consistent and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN blog posts use relative image paths (like `./cover.png`) THEN the system SHALL resolve these paths correctly
2. WHEN images are in different formats (PNG, JPG, WebP) THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately
3. IF an image fails to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to the placeholder image
4. WHEN images are processed by Astro's image optimization THEN they SHALL maintain proper aspect ratios and quality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to be able to specify cover images for my blog posts using standard frontmatter syntax, so that my posts are visually appealing and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define a cover image using `cover: ./image.png` in frontmatter THEN the image SHALL be displayed correctly
2. WHEN I define a cover image using `cover: ./image.jpg` in frontmatter THEN the image SHALL be displayed correctly
3. WHEN I omit the cover field from frontmatter THEN the placeholder image SHALL be used
4. WHEN I provide an invalid or missing image path THEN the placeholder image SHALL be used as fallback
