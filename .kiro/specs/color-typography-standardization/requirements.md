# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the inconsistent use of color classes and typography across the Hackerspace Mumbai website components. The current implementation uses non-standard color classes like `text-accent` and `hover:text-accent-foreground` that don't align with the DaisyUI color system defined in global.css. Additionally, typography styling needs standardization across Header and Footer components to ensure visual consistency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the website, I want all color classes to use the standardized DaisyUI color system, so that the design remains consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any component THEN all color classes SHALL use only DaisyUI-defined color variables (primary, secondary, accent, neutral, base-100, base-200, base-300, base-content, primary-content, etc.)
2. WHEN a hover state is applied THEN it SHALL use valid DaisyUI color combinations that exist in the theme
3. IF a component uses `text-accent` THEN it SHALL be replaced with appropriate DaisyUI color classes
4. IF a component uses `hover:text-accent-foreground` THEN it SHALL be replaced with valid DaisyUI hover color classes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user visiting the website, I want consistent typography and spacing across all navigation elements, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Header component THEN typography classes SHALL be consistent with the overall design system
2. WHEN viewing the Footer component THEN typography classes SHALL match the Header's styling approach
3. WHEN comparing Header and Footer THEN font sizes, weights, and spacing SHALL follow a consistent pattern
4. IF text has hover states THEN the transitions SHALL be uniform across components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working on the website, I want all components referenced in index.astro to follow the color guidelines, so that the entire homepage maintains visual consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN index.astro renders any component THEN all components SHALL use only approved DaisyUI color classes
2. WHEN custom styles are applied in index.astro THEN they SHALL complement the DaisyUI theme colors
3. IF any component uses non-standard color classes THEN they SHALL be updated to use DaisyUI equivalents
4. WHEN the page loads THEN all color combinations SHALL provide proper contrast and readability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a designer reviewing the website, I want all color usage to be documented and consistent, so that future changes maintain the established design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing color usage THEN all components SHALL use colors that exist in the DaisyUI theme configuration
2. WHEN a color is used for text THEN it SHALL have appropriate contrast with its background
3. IF multiple components use similar styling THEN they SHALL use identical class combinations
4. WHEN hover effects are applied THEN they SHALL use semantically appropriate color transitions
