# Design Document

## Overview

This design enhances the sponsor cards section to create a more visually appealing, professional, and well-aligned presentation. The design leverages the existing DaisyUI dark theme and follows the established design patterns used throughout the site, while introducing modern card styling with improved spacing, hover effects, and responsive behavior.

## Architecture

The sponsor cards enhancement will follow Astro's component-based development approach with a dedicated component structure:

- **SponsorsSection.astro**: Main container component that manages the grid layout and receives sponsor data as props
- **SponsorCard.astro**: Individual card component for consistent UX and reusability
- **Sponsor data structure**: Maintains current format with potential for future logo support
- **Responsive grid system**: Enhanced grid layout using Tailwind CSS classes
- **DaisyUI integration**: Leverages existing color system and component classes

This separation ensures:
- **Reusability**: SponsorCard can be used in other contexts (footer, about page, etc.)
- **Maintainability**: Card styling changes only need to be made in one place
- **Consistency**: All sponsor cards will have identical styling and behavior
- **Testability**: Individual card component can be tested in isolation

## Components and Interfaces

### SponsorsSection Component

The main container component that manages the grid layout:

```typescript
interface Props {
  sponsors: Sponsor[];
}
```

### SponsorCard Component

Individual card component for consistent UX and reusability:

```typescript
interface Sponsor {
  name: string;
  logo?: string;  // Optional for future logo support
  url?: string;   // Optional for future link support
}

interface Props {
  sponsor: Sponsor;
}
```

### Card Design System

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Primary container: `bg-base-100` with subtle elevation
- Card borders: `border border-base-300` for definition
- Hover states: Enhanced with `hover:bg-base-200` and `hover:border-primary`
- Typography: Consistent with site's design using `text-base-content`

**Spacing System:**
- Card dimensions: Fixed height for consistency (h-40 or h-48)
- Internal padding: `p-6` for comfortable content spacing
- Grid gaps: `gap-6` for proper separation
- Section padding: Maintains current `py-16 px-4`

**Responsive Behavior:**
- Mobile (default): 1 column with full-width cards
- Tablet (md): 2 columns with balanced spacing
- Desktop (lg): 3-4 columns optimizing screen real estate

## Data Models

### Current Sponsor Model
```javascript
const sponsors = [
  { name: "Microsoft", logo: "microsoft.png" },
  { name: "Google", logo: "google.png" },
  { name: "DigitalOcean", logo: "digitalocean.png" },
];
```

### Enhanced Sponsor Model (Future-Ready)
```javascript
const sponsors = [
  { 
    name: "Microsoft", 
    logo: "microsoft.png",
    url: "https://microsoft.com",
    tier: "platinum" // Optional for different styling tiers
  },
  // ... other sponsors
];
```

## Visual Design Specifications

### Card Styling
- **Background**: `bg-base-100` (dark theme: oklch(14% 0.005 285.823))
- **Border**: `border border-base-300` with `rounded-xl` for modern appearance
- **Shadow**: `shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl` for depth and interaction feedback
- **Transition**: `transition-all duration-300` for smooth hover effects

### Typography
- **Sponsor Name**: `text-lg font-semibold text-base-content`
- **Alignment**: `text-center` for consistent presentation
- **Line Height**: Optimized for readability within card constraints

### Interactive States
- **Default**: Subtle shadow and border
- **Hover**: Enhanced shadow, border color change to `border-primary`, background shift to `bg-base-200`
- **Focus**: Keyboard navigation support with `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary`

### Grid Layout
```css
/* Mobile First */
grid-cols-1 gap-6

/* Tablet */
md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-8

/* Desktop */
lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4
```

## Error Handling

### Missing Sponsor Data
- Graceful handling of empty sponsor arrays
- Default placeholder text for missing sponsor names
- Fallback styling for missing logos (current text-based approach)

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Ensure cards maintain minimum readable size on all devices
- Prevent layout breaking with varying content lengths
- Handle edge cases with very long sponsor names

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Regression Testing
- Screenshot comparisons across different viewport sizes
- Hover state verification
- Focus state accessibility testing

### Responsive Testing
- Mobile devices (320px - 768px)
- Tablet devices (768px - 1024px)
- Desktop devices (1024px+)
- Ultra-wide displays (1440px+)

### Accessibility Testing
- Keyboard navigation functionality
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast validation (already handled by DaisyUI theme)
- Focus indicators visibility

### Cross-Browser Testing
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Styling Enhancement
- Update card styling with new background, borders, and shadows
- Implement hover effects and transitions
- Enhance typography and spacing

### Phase 2: Responsive Optimization
- Refine grid layout for different screen sizes
- Optimize card dimensions and spacing
- Test and adjust breakpoint behavior

### Phase 3: Accessibility & Polish
- Add keyboard navigation support
- Implement focus states
- Final visual polish and testing

## Design Rationale

### Color Scheme Consistency
Using the established DaisyUI dark theme ensures visual harmony with the rest of the site while providing sufficient contrast for sponsor visibility.

### Card-Based Design
Modern card-based layouts provide clear visual separation, improve scannability, and create a professional appearance suitable for sponsor recognition.

### Responsive-First Approach
Mobile-first design ensures optimal experience across all devices, with progressive enhancement for larger screens.

### Future-Proof Structure
The design accommodates future enhancements like sponsor logos, links, and tiered sponsorship levels without requiring architectural changes.
