# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The blog index page at `src/pages/blog/index.astro` currently contains inline card styling and logic that duplicates functionality already available in the `BlogCard.astro` component. This modernization effort aims to refactor the blog index page to use the existing BlogCard component, following the established modernization patterns from previous website enhancement sessions. The goal is to eliminate code duplication, improve maintainability, ensure consistent styling, and align with the accessibility and responsive design standards established in the blog-section-beautification and website-modernization specifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the blog section, I want the blog index page to use the existing BlogCard component and follow established modernization patterns, so that I can maintain consistent styling and reduce code duplication across the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the blog index page is rendered THEN it SHALL use the BlogCard component for displaying individual blog posts
2. WHEN the blog index page is refactored THEN it SHALL remove all inline post card styling and logic
3. WHEN the BlogCard component is used THEN it SHALL receive the correct post data and props with proper TypeScript interfaces
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the visual appearance SHALL remain consistent with the current design while following the enhanced styling patterns from blog-section-beautification
5. WHEN the component structure is updated THEN it SHALL follow the same patterns established in the website-modernization specification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor to the blog, I want the blog index page to display posts in a modern, responsive grid layout with enhanced visual appeal, so that I can easily browse through available articles on any device with an engaging user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the blog index page loads THEN it SHALL display posts in a responsive grid layout using the enhanced grid system from blog-section-beautification
2. WHEN viewed on different screen sizes THEN the grid SHALL adapt appropriately (1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 3 columns desktop)
3. WHEN posts are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain consistent spacing using the standardized gap system (gap-6 mobile, gap-8 desktop)
4. WHEN the page contains multiple posts THEN they SHALL be sorted by date in descending order
5. WHEN cards are displayed THEN they SHALL include enhanced hover effects and transitions following the established design patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor to the blog, I want to see proper reading time calculations and rich metadata for each post, so that I can make informed decisions about which articles to read with comprehensive post information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog post is displayed THEN it SHALL show an accurate reading time estimate based on the actual post content
2. WHEN reading time is calculated THEN it SHALL use the standardized algorithm (200 words per minute) established in the BlogCard component
3. WHEN post metadata is shown THEN it SHALL include author, formatted date, and reading time with proper visual hierarchy
4. WHEN the BlogCard component is used THEN it SHALL display rich metadata with icons and proper spacing following the design system
5. WHEN tags are present THEN they SHALL be displayed as styled badges with proper truncation (max 3 visible, "+X more" indicator)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the blog index page to have clean, maintainable code structure following established modernization patterns, so that future modifications are easier to implement and consistent with the site architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the blog index page SHALL have minimal custom styling, delegating to the BlogCard component
2. WHEN the page is structured THEN it SHALL separate concerns between layout, data fetching, and component rendering
3. WHEN the code is reviewed THEN it SHALL follow the component architecture patterns established in website-modernization
4. WHEN the BlogCard component is imported THEN it SHALL be used with proper TypeScript interfaces matching the established CollectionEntry<'posts'> type
5. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL include graceful fallbacks for missing data following the error handling patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a visitor to the blog, I want the blog header and navigation to remain functional and visually appealing with enhanced accessibility, so that I can understand the context and navigate effectively using any input method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the blog index page loads THEN it SHALL display the existing blog header with hero background maintaining current visual design
2. WHEN the header is rendered THEN it SHALL include proper semantic HTML structure with appropriate heading hierarchy
3. WHEN the page structure is updated THEN the Layout component SHALL continue to work properly with enhanced SEO metadata
4. WHEN SEO metadata is rendered THEN it SHALL include appropriate title, description, Open Graph, and Twitter Card meta tags
5. WHEN accessibility is considered THEN the page SHALL include proper ARIA labels, landmarks, and keyboard navigation support

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a visitor with disabilities, I want the blog index page to be fully accessible, so that I can navigate and interact with all blog content using assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page is accessed with screen readers THEN all blog post information SHALL be properly announced with semantic markup
2. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN all blog post cards SHALL be focusable with visible focus indicators
3. WHEN the page structure is rendered THEN it SHALL use proper heading hierarchy and landmark elements
4. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL have descriptive alt text or be marked as decorative
5. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN they SHALL have appropriate ARIA labels and roles

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a visitor on various devices and network conditions, I want the blog index page to load quickly and perform well, so that I can access blog content efficiently regardless of my device or connection speed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are loaded THEN they SHALL use lazy loading and proper optimization techniques
2. WHEN the page renders THEN it SHALL minimize Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) through proper image sizing
3. WHEN animations are present THEN they SHALL respect user preferences for reduced motion
4. WHEN the page is accessed on slow networks THEN loading states SHALL be displayed appropriately
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN the page SHALL meet Core Web Vitals thresholds established in the modernization standards
