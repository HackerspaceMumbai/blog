  - Simplify post data preparation to focus only on sorting and filtering
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Enhance semantic HTML structure and accessibility

  - Add reduced motion support for animations and transitions
  - Optimize grid layout for better rendering performance
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3_

- [ ] 9. Create comprehensive test suite for refactored page
  - Write unit tests for BlogCard component integration
  - Create visual regression tests comparing before/after refactoring
  - Implement accessibility tests for keyboard navigation and screen readers
  - Add responsive design tests across all breakpoints
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 6.2, 6.4_

- [ ] 10. Validate accessibility compliance and keyboard navigation
  - Test complete keyboard navigation flow through blog post cards
  - Verify screen reader compatibility with semantic markup
