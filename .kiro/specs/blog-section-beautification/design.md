# Design Document

## Overview

This design enhances the blog section to create a more visually appealing, professional, and engaging presentation of blog posts. The design leverages the existing DaisyUI dark theme and follows the established design patterns used throughout the site, while introducing modern card styling with improved spacing, hover effects, responsive behavior, and rich metadata display similar to the successful sponsor cards beautification.

## Architecture

The blog section enhancement will follow Astro's component-based development approach with an improved component structure:

- **BlogSection.astro**: Main container component that manages the grid layout and receives blog posts as props
- **BlogCard.astro**: New dedicated individual card component for consistent UX and reusability
- **Blog post data structure**: Enhanced to support rich metadata display and cover image handling
- **Responsive grid system**: Enhanced grid layout using Tailwind CSS classes with better breakpoint handling
- **DaisyUI integration**: Leverages existing color system and component classes for consistency

This separation ensures:
- **Reusability**: BlogCard can be used in other contexts (related posts, featured posts, etc.)
- **Maintainability**: Card styling changes only need to be made in one place
- **Consistency**: All blog post cards will have identical styling and behavior
- **Testability**: Individual card component can be tested in isolation

## Components and Interfaces

### BlogSection Component

The main container component that manages the grid layout:

```typescript
interface Props {
  posts: CollectionEntry<'posts'>[];
}
```

### BlogCard Component

New dedicated individual card component for consistent UX and reusability:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  slug: string;
  data: {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    author: string;
    date: Date;
    cover?: string;
    tags?: string[];
  };
  body: string;
}

interface Props {
  post: BlogPost;
  showTags?: boolean;
  showReadingTime?: boolean;
}
```

### Card Design System

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Primary container: `bg-base-100` with enhanced elevation and borders
- Card borders: `border border-base-300` with `hover:border-primary` for interaction
- Hover states: Enhanced with `hover:bg-base-200` and `hover:shadow-xl`
- Typography: Consistent hierarchy with `text-base-content` and proper sizing

**Content Structure:**
- Cover image: Fixed aspect ratio (16:9) with proper fallback handling
- Title: `text-xl font-bold` with line clamping for consistency
- Metadata: Author, date, reading time with subtle styling
- Description: `text-base-content/80` with proper truncation
- Tags: Styled badges with truncation for long lists
- CTA: Consistent button styling matching site design

**Spacing System:**
- Card dimensions: Flexible height with consistent minimum heights
- Internal padding: `p-6` for comfortable content spacing
- Grid gaps: `gap-6` for proper separation between cards
- Section padding: Enhanced `py-20 px-4` for better visual breathing room

**Responsive Behavior:**
- Mobile (default): 1 column with full-width cards
- Tablet (md): 2 columns with balanced spacing
- Desktop (lg): 3 columns optimizing screen real estate
- Large desktop (xl): Maintains 3 columns with increased gaps

## Data Models

### Current Blog Post Model
```javascript
const posts = [
  {
    slug: "post-slug",
    data: {
      title: "Blog Post Title",
      description: "Post description...",
      author: "Author Name",
      date: new Date(),
      cover: "cover-image.jpg",
      tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
    },
    body: "Post content..."
  }
];
```

### Enhanced Blog Post Processing
```javascript
// Reading time calculation
function calculateReadingTime(text: string): number {
  const wordsPerMinute = 200;
  const words = text.split(/\s+/).length;
  return Math.ceil(words / wordsPerMinute) || 1;
}

// Enhanced post data with computed fields
const enhancedPosts = posts.map(post => ({
  ...post,
  readingTime: calculateReadingTime(post.body),
  formattedDate: new Date(post.data.date).toLocaleDateString('en-IN', {
    year: 'numeric',
    month: 'short',
    day: 'numeric',
  }),
  coverImagePath: post.data.cover ? `/src/assets/images/${post.data.cover}` : null
}));
```

## Visual Design Specifications

### Card Styling
- **Background**: `bg-base-100` (dark theme: oklch(14% 0.005 285.823))
- **Border**: `border border-base-300` with `rounded-xl` for modern appearance
- **Shadow**: `shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl` for depth and interaction feedback
- **Transition**: `transition-all duration-300` for smooth hover effects
- **Height**: `h-full` with `flex flex-col` for consistent card heights

### Cover Image Handling
- **Aspect Ratio**: `aspect-video` (16:9) for consistency
- **Object Fit**: `object-cover` to maintain aspect ratio
- **Loading**: `loading="lazy"` for performance
- **Fallback**: Gradient background with post title overlay for missing images
- **Hover Effect**: Subtle scale transform on image hover

### Typography Hierarchy
- **Title**: `text-xl font-bold text-base-content` with `line-clamp-2`
- **Metadata**: `text-sm text-base-content/70` with proper spacing
- **Description**: `text-base-content/80` with `line-clamp-3`
- **Tags**: `text-xs` in styled badges with `bg-primary/10 text-primary`
- **CTA**: Consistent with site's button styling

### Interactive States
- **Default**: Subtle shadow and border
- **Hover**: Enhanced shadow, border color change to `border-primary`, background shift to `bg-base-200`
- **Focus**: Keyboard navigation support with `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary`
- **Image Hover**: Subtle scale effect `hover:scale-105`

### Grid Layout
```css
/* Mobile First */
grid-cols-1 gap-6

/* Tablet */
md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-8

/* Desktop */
lg:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-8
```

### Metadata Display
- **Author & Date**: Displayed together with separator dot
- **Reading Time**: Displayed separately with clock icon
- **Tags**: Maximum 3 visible tags with "+X more" indicator
- **Layout**: Flexbox with proper spacing and alignment

## Error Handling

### Missing Cover Images
- Graceful fallback to gradient background with title overlay
- Consistent aspect ratio maintained even without images
- Loading state handling for slow image loads

### Content Variations
- Title truncation with ellipsis for long titles
- Description truncation with proper line clamping
- Tag list truncation with overflow indication
- Flexible card heights with minimum height constraints

### Responsive Edge Cases
- Very long titles or descriptions handled gracefully
- Empty or minimal content scenarios
- Single post or few posts layout adaptation

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Regression Testing
- Screenshot comparisons across different viewport sizes
- Hover state verification for all interactive elements
- Focus state accessibility testing
- Cover image loading and fallback testing

### Content Variation Testing
- Long titles and descriptions
- Missing cover images
- Varying tag counts
- Different post counts (1, 2, 3+ posts)

### Responsive Testing
- Mobile devices (320px - 768px)
- Tablet devices (768px - 1024px)
- Desktop devices (1024px+)
- Ultra-wide displays (1440px+)

### Accessibility Testing

## Design Rationale

### Consistency with Sponsor Cards
Following the successful sponsor cards beautification approach ensures visual consistency across the site while providing users with a familiar interaction pattern.

### Enhanced Visual Hierarchy
Clear typography hierarchy and proper spacing guide users' attention from cover images to titles to metadata, improving content discoverability.

### Performance Considerations
Lazy loading images and optimized hover effects ensure the enhanced visual appeal doesn't compromise site performance.

### Future-Proof Structure
The component-based approach allows for easy addition of features like related posts, featured posts, or different blog post layouts without architectural changes.

### Mobile-First Responsive Design
Ensuring optimal experience on mobile devices first, with progressive enhancement for larger screens, aligns with modern web usage patterns.
