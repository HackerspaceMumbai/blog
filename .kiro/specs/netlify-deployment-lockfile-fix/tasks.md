# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix pnpm lockfile synchronization issue







  - Regenerate pnpm-lock.yaml to include sanitize-html dependency
  - Verify lockfile integrity and version consistency
  - Test that sanitize-html can be imported and used correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Update visual regression tests to be CI-friendly






  - Modify BlogImageVisualRegression.deployment.test.js to detect CI environment
  - Add dev server availability check before running visual tests
  - Implement graceful test skipping when dev server is unavailable
  - Add clear logging messages for test status and reasons for skipping
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 3. Create environment detection utility for tests






  - Write utility function to detect CI environment (GitHub Actions, Netlify)
  - Add dev server availability checker with timeout handling
  - Create test environment configuration helper
  - Write unit tests for environment detection utilities
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 6.1, 6.2_

- [ ] 4. Enhance Netlify build configuration for resilience
  - Update netlify.toml with fallback build strategies for lockfile issues
  - Add environment-specific pnpm configuration
  - Include clear error reporting and recovery instructions in build logs
  - Test build configuration with various lockfile states
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Add dependency management validation scripts






  - Create script to validate package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml synchronization
  - Add pre-commit hook to check lockfile consistency
  - Write automated tests to verify sanitize-html integration
  - Create documentation for dependency management best practices
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Update GitHub Actions workflow handling





  - Modify test scripts to handle CI environment appropriately
  - Add conditional test execution based on environment and server availability
  - Implement proper error reporting for CI failures
  - Create fallback testing strategies for CI environments
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 7. Create comprehensive test suite for CI/CD fixes
  - Write integration tests for lockfile synchronization
  - Add tests for environment-aware visual regression behavior
  - Create deployment validation tests
  - Write tests for error handling and recovery scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 5.1, 5.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 8. Add monitoring and alerting for deployment health
  - Create health check endpoints for dependency validation
  - Add logging for lockfile sync status during builds
  - Implement deployment success/failure tracking
  - Create alerts for recurring CI/CD issues
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 6.3_
