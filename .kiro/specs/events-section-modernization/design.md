# Design Document

## Overview

This design modernizes and aesthetically enhances the events section to create a more visually appealing, professional, and engaging presentation of upcoming events. The design leverages the existing DaisyUI dark theme and follows the established design patterns used in the sponsor cards and blog sections, while introducing modern card styling with improved visual hierarchy, better image handling, enhanced spacing, and smooth interactions.

## Architecture

The events section enhancement will follow Astro's component-based development approach with an enhanced component structure:

- **EventsSection.astro**: Main container component that manages the responsive grid layout and receives event data as props
- **EventCard.astro**: New dedicated individual event card component for consistent UX and reusability
- **Event data structure**: Maintains current Event interface with enhanced styling support
- **Responsive grid system**: Enhanced grid layout using Tailwind CSS classes optimized for event content
- **DaisyUI integration**: Leverages existing color system and component classes with modern enhancements

This separation ensures:
- **Reusability**: EventCard can be used in other contexts (archive page, featured events, etc.)
- **Maintainability**: Card styling changes only need to be made in one place
- **Consistency**: All event cards will have identical styling and behavior
- **Testability**: Individual card component can be tested in isolation
- **Performance**: Optimized image handling and efficient rendering

## Components and Interfaces

### EventsSection Component

The main container component that manages the grid layout:

```typescript
interface Props {
  events: Event[];
}
```

### EventCard Component

New dedicated individual event card component:

```typescript
interface Event {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  location: string;
  description: string;
  rsvpLink: string;
  coverImage?: string;
}

interface Props {
  event: Event;
}
```

### Enhanced Card Design System

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Primary container: `bg-base-100` with enhanced elevation and modern shadows
- Card borders: `border border-base-300` with rounded corners for modern appearance
- Hover states: Enhanced with `hover:bg-base-200`, `hover:border-primary`, and `hover:shadow-xl`
- Typography: Improved hierarchy with distinct styling for title, date/location, and description

**Image Handling:**
- Cover images: Elegant background treatment with proper overlay for text readability
- Fallback styling: Consistent appearance for events without cover images
- Responsive images: Proper sizing and positioning across all screen sizes

**Spacing System:**
- Card dimensions: Optimized height for event content (min-h-80)
- Internal padding: `p-6` for comfortable content spacing with additional padding for image overlays
- Grid gaps: `gap-8` for proper separation between cards
- Section padding: Enhanced `py-20 px-4` for better section definition

**Responsive Behavior:**
- Mobile (default): 1 column with full-width cards optimized for mobile viewing
- Tablet (md): 2 columns with balanced spacing
- Desktop (lg): 2-3 columns based on content optimization

## Data Models

  }
];
```

## Visual Design Specifications

### Card Styling (DaisyUI v5 + Tailwind CSS v4 Only)
- **Background**: `bg-base-100` using DaisyUI semantic colors
- **Border**: `border border-base-300 rounded-xl` for modern appearance
- **Shadow**: `shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl` using Tailwind's built-in shadow utilities
- **Transition**: `transition-all duration-300` using Tailwind transition utilities
- **Minimum Height**: `min-h-80` for consistent card dimensions using Tailwind sizing

### Typography Hierarchy
- **Event Title**: `text-xl font-bold text-base-content mb-3`
- **Date & Location**: `text-sm font-medium text-primary mb-4` with icon integration
- **Description**: `text-base text-base-content/80 mb-6 line-clamp-3`
- **RSVP Button**: Enhanced styling with `btn btn-primary w-full`

### Image Treatment (Tailwind CSS v4 Only)
- **With Cover Image**: 
  - Background image with `bg-cover bg-center` using Tailwind utilities
  - Dark overlay: `bg-gradient-to-t from-black/80 to-transparent` using Tailwind gradient utilities
  - Text positioning: `relative z-10` using Tailwind positioning utilities
- **Without Cover Image**:

## Design Rationale

### Modern Card Design
Following current design trends with enhanced shadows, rounded corners, and smooth interactions creates a more engaging and professional appearance that aligns with modern web standards.

### Enhanced Visual Hierarchy
Clear typography hierarchy helps users quickly scan and understand event information, improving the user experience and encouraging event attendance.

### Improved Image Integration
Elegant handling of cover images with proper overlays ensures text readability while maintaining visual appeal, creating a more engaging presentation.

### Responsive-First Approach
Mobile-first design ensures optimal experience across all devices, with progressive enhancement for larger screens and better content presentation.

### Consistency with Site Design
Leveraging the established DaisyUI theme and design patterns ensures visual harmony with the rest of the site while providing a cohesive user experience.

### Future-Proof Architecture
The component structure accommodates future enhancements like event categories, pricing, capacity indicators, and additional metadata without requiring architectural changes.
