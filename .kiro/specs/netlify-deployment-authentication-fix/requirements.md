# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Hackerspace Mumbai website's GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is failing during the deploy-preview job due to Netlify CLI authentication issues. The specific problem is that the `netlify deploy` command in the `deploy:preview` script is attempting interactive authentication instead of using the provided `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable, resulting in a "Timed out waiting for authorization" error. This prevents pull request preview deployments from working, breaking the development workflow and preventing proper testing of changes before they reach production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pull request preview deployments to work automatically, so that I can test changes before merging to main.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the deploy-preview GitHub Action job SHALL complete successfully without authentication timeouts
2. WHEN the deploy-preview job runs THEN it SHALL use the NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable for authentication instead of interactive login
3. WHEN the Netlify CLI executes THEN it SHALL authenticate using the provided token without requiring manual authorization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the Netlify deployment commands to be properly configured for CI environments, so that automated deployments work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deploy:preview script runs in GitHub Actions THEN it SHALL use non-interactive authentication methods
2. WHEN environment variables NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN and NETLIFY_SITE_ID are provided THEN the Netlify CLI SHALL use them automatically
3. WHEN the deployment command executes THEN it SHALL not attempt to open browser-based authorization flows

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want clear error handling and logging for deployment failures, so that authentication issues can be quickly diagnosed and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment authentication fails THEN the error message SHALL clearly indicate the authentication method being used
2. WHEN the GitHub Action fails THEN it SHALL provide actionable information about missing or invalid credentials
3. WHEN debugging deployment issues THEN the logs SHALL show whether environment variables are properly set and being used

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the deployment scripts to work consistently across different environments, so that local testing and CI deployments behave predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running deployment commands locally THEN they SHALL work with the same authentication method as CI
2. WHEN switching between local and CI environments THEN the deployment process SHALL adapt automatically to the available authentication method
3. WHEN the deployment configuration is updated THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with both local development and CI workflows

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want deployment authentication to use secure token-based methods, so that credentials are not exposed or compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication tokens are used THEN they SHALL be stored securely as GitHub repository secrets
2. WHEN the deployment process runs THEN it SHALL not log or expose authentication credentials in build outputs
3. WHEN token-based authentication is configured THEN it SHALL follow Netlify's recommended security practices for CI/CD integration
