# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update package.json deployment scripts for explicit authentication






  - Modify deploy:preview script to use `netlify deploy --site=$NETLIFY_SITE_ID --dir=dist --functions=netlify/functions`
  - Modify deploy:prod script to use `netlify deploy --prod --site=$NETLIFY_SITE_ID --dir=dist --functions=netlify/functions`
  - Add new deploy:preview:ci and deploy:prod:ci scripts with `--json` flag for structured CI output
  - Test that updated scripts work with environment variables and don't trigger interactive prompts
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Enhance GitHub Actions workflow with authentication verification




  - Add "Verify Netlify credentials" step that checks NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN and NETLIFY_SITE_ID environment variables
  - Add `netlify status --json` command to verify authentication works before deployment
  - Update deploy-preview job to use `pnpm deploy:preview:ci` instead of `pnpm deploy:preview`
  - Add GitHub Actions error annotations (::error::) for missing credentials with actionable error messages
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Create deployment configuration validation utility






  - Create `scripts/validate-deployment-config.js` utility to check NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN and NETLIFY_SITE_ID
  - Implement CI environment detection using `process.env.CI` and `process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS`
  - Add `netlify status --json` validation to verify token works before deployment attempts
  - Write unit tests in `scripts/__tests__/validate-deployment-config.test.js` for all validation scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1_

- [x] 4. Update deployment shell script with CI environment support






  - Modify scripts/deploy.sh to detect CI environment using `$CI` and `$GITHUB_ACTIONS` variables
  - Replace `netlify deploy` calls with explicit `--site=$NETLIFY_SITE_ID` parameter
  - Add `netlify status` verification before deployment attempts in CI mode
  - Implement fallback to interactive `netlify login` only for local development (non-CI) environments
  - Add error handling that provides specific guidance for missing NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN or NETLIFY_SITE_ID
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 5. Add deployment authentication verification tests






  - Create `scripts/__tests__/deployment-auth.test.js` to test authentication token validation
  - Write tests for environment variable presence and format validation
  - Implement tests that mock `netlify status` command to verify authentication flow
  - Add integration tests that verify CI environment detection works correctly
  - Test error scenarios like missing tokens, invalid tokens, and network failures
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 4.3, 5.3_

- [x] 6. Implement deployment retry logic and error handling






  - Create `scripts/deploy-with-retry.js` wrapper that implements exponential backoff for network failures
  - Add retry logic specifically for `netlify deploy` command failures (max 3 retries)
  - Implement structured error logging that sanitizes NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN from error messages
  - Add deployment status verification using `netlify api listSiteDeploys` after successful deployment
  - Write tests to verify retry logic and credential sanitization work correctly
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 7. Create post-deployment health check integration






  - Modify deployment scripts to extract deployment URL from `netlify deploy --json` output
  - Add automated execution of existing `pnpm health:check` after successful deployments
  - Create `scripts/post-deployment-verify.js` to verify deployment URL accessibility and basic functionality
  - Update GitHub Actions workflow to report deployment URL and health check status as job summary
  - Write tests to verify URL extraction and health check integration work correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.2, 4.3_

- [x] 8. Add comprehensive deployment logging and monitoring






  - Create `scripts/deployment-logger.js` utility for structured logging with timestamp, environment, and deployment status
  - Implement deployment metrics collection that tracks duration, success/failure rates, and error categories
  - Add credential sanitization function that removes NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN from all log outputs and error messages
  - Integrate logging with GitHub Actions workflow to provide detailed deployment summaries and error reporting
  - Write comprehensive tests to verify no sensitive information is exposed in logs under any error conditions
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 9. Update project documentation for deployment authentication





  - Update README.md with section on Netlify deployment setup and required environment variables
  - Document the GitHub repository secrets setup process (NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN, NETLIFY_SITE_ID)
  - Create deployment troubleshooting guide in docs/ directory with common authentication issues and solutions
  - Add developer onboarding documentation for local development deployment setup
  - Document the difference between CI and local deployment workflows
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 4.1_
