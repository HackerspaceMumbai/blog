# Implementation Plan

## Alt Text Improvement Tasks

This implementation plan focuses specifically on improving image alt text across the Hackerspace Mumbai website to enhance accessibility for screen reader users. The goal is to remove redundant words like "image", "photo", and "picture" while ensuring all images have descriptive, meaningful alternative text.

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory
2. **Install dependencies** using `pnpm install`
3. **Start the development server** with `pnpm dev`
4. **Review the requirements.md and design.md** files in this spec folder for context

### Alt Text Guidelines
- Remove redundant words: "image", "photo", "picture", "graphic"
- Keep descriptions concise (under 125 characters when possible)
- Use active voice and present tense
- Focus on content and purpose, not visual appearance
- Use empty alt="" for purely decorative images
- Describe the function for linked images, not just the image content

### Testing Your Changes
- Use screen reader software (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) to test alt text
- Run accessibility audits with the built-in tools (`pnpm run dev`)
- Verify that alt text provides the same information as the visual content
- Check that decorative images are properly marked with empty alt attributes
