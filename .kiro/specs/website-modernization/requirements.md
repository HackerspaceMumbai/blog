# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for improving image accessibility on the Hackerspace Mumbai website by fixing alt text attributes. The goal is to ensure all images have proper, descriptive alt text that follows accessibility best practices, removing redundant words like "image", "photo", and "picture" that screen readers already announce.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Image Alt Text Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a screen reader user, I want all images to have descriptive alt text without redundant words so that I can understand the content and purpose of images without unnecessary repetition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen reader users encounter images THEN all images SHALL have descriptive alt text that describes the content or purpose
2. WHEN alt text is written THEN it SHALL NOT include redundant words like "image", "photo", "picture", or "graphic"
3. WHEN decorative images are present THEN they SHALL have empty alt attributes (alt="") to be ignored by screen readers
4. WHEN informative images are present THEN alt text SHALL convey the same information the image provides
5. WHEN complex images (charts, diagrams) are present THEN alt text SHALL provide a concise description with detailed descriptions available elsewhere
6. WHEN images contain text THEN the alt text SHALL include that text content
7. WHEN images are links THEN alt text SHALL describe the link destination or function, not just the image

### Requirement 2: Alt Text Content Guidelines

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want clear guidelines for writing effective alt text so that I can create accessible content that provides value to screen reader users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing alt text for logos THEN it SHALL include the organization name and purpose (e.g., "Hackerspace Mumbai logo")
2. WHEN writing alt text for event photos THEN it SHALL describe the key activity or scene (e.g., "Developers collaborating at a coding workshop")
3. WHEN writing alt text for speaker photos THEN it SHALL identify the person and context (e.g., "John Smith presenting at tech meetup")
4. WHEN writing alt text for screenshots THEN it SHALL describe the interface or content shown
5. WHEN writing alt text for charts or graphs THEN it SHALL summarize the key data or trend
6. WHEN images are purely decorative THEN they SHALL use empty alt attributes (alt="")
7. WHEN images contain important text THEN the alt text SHALL include that text content

### Requirement 3: Alt Text Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a screen reader user, I want alt text to be concise yet descriptive so that I can quickly understand image content without being overwhelmed by unnecessary details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN alt text is written THEN it SHALL be concise, typically under 125 characters
2. WHEN alt text describes people THEN it SHALL focus on relevant context rather than physical appearance
3. WHEN alt text describes actions THEN it SHALL use active voice and present tense
4. WHEN alt text describes locations THEN it SHALL provide relevant spatial context
5. WHEN multiple similar images exist THEN alt text SHALL differentiate between them
6. WHEN images are part of a sequence THEN alt text SHALL indicate the sequence or relationship
7. WHEN alt text would be repetitive with surrounding text THEN it SHALL provide additional context or use empty alt
