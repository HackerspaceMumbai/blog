- [ ] Error handling working correctly
- [ ] Rate limiting functional
- [ ] Analytics tracking working
- [ ] Email confirmations being sent (if configured)

## ✅ Production Monitoring

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Monitor function invocation counts
- [ ] Check error rates in Netlify dashboard
- [ ] Review subscription success rates
- [ ] Monitor Kit API connectivity

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Review function performance metrics
- [ ] Check for any security alerts
- [ ] Verify backup systems functioning
- [ ] Review user feedback/support tickets

### Monthly Checks
- [ ] Update dependencies if needed
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys
- [ ] Performance optimization review
- [ ] Security audit

## ✅ Testing Commands

Run these commands to verify production readiness:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm run test
npm run functions:test
npm run functions:test:integration

# Build and verify
npm run build

# Test locally with Netlify Dev
npm run dev:netlify

# Test health endpoint locally
npm run health:check:local

# Test newsletter function locally
npm run newsletter:test

# Deploy to preview (with safety checks)
./scripts/deploy.sh preview
# OR for quick preview: npm run deploy:preview

# Deploy to production (always use script for safety)
./scripts/deploy.sh production
```

## ✅ Emergency Procedures

### If Newsletter Service Fails
1. Check health endpoint: `https://hackmum.in/.netlify/functions/health`
2. Review Netlify function logs
3. Verify Kit API status
4. Check environment variables
5. Consider enabling fallback storage mode

### If High Error Rates Detected
1. Check Netlify function logs for error patterns
2. Verify Kit API connectivity
3. Check for DDoS or abuse patterns
4. Consider temporarily increasing rate limits
5. Monitor for resolution

### If Security Incident Detected
1. Immediately rotate all API keys
2. Review access logs for suspicious activity
3. Check for unauthorized subscriptions
4. Update security configurations
5. Document incident for future prevention

## ✅ Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Metrics
- Function cold start: <3 seconds
- Function warm execution: <500ms
- Newsletter subscription: <2 seconds end-to-end
- Health check response: <200ms
- Error rate: <1% under normal conditions
- Success rate: >99% for valid submissions

### Load Testing Targets
- Handle 100 concurrent subscriptions
- Maintain <2s response time under load
- Graceful degradation under extreme load
- Rate limiting prevents service overload
