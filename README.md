## üöÄ Deployment

### Netlify Deployment Setup

This project is configured for automated deployment to Netlify through GitHub Actions. The deployment process requires proper authentication setup for both CI/CD and local development.

#### Required Environment Variables

For successful deployment, you need to configure the following environment variables:

- **`NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`**: Personal access token for Netlify API authentication
- **`NETLIFY_SITE_ID`**: Unique identifier for your Netlify site

#### GitHub Repository Secrets Setup

1. **Generate Netlify Auth Token:**
   - Go to [Netlify User Settings > Applications](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications)
   - Click "New access token"
   - Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "GitHub Actions Deploy")
   - Copy the generated token

2. **Find Your Site ID:**
   - Go to your site in Netlify dashboard
   - Navigate to Site Settings > General
   - Copy the "Site ID" from the Site Information section

3. **Add GitHub Secrets:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Add the following repository secrets:
     - `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Netlify access token
     - `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`: Your Netlify site ID

#### Deployment Commands

| Command                | Action                                           |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `pnpm deploy:preview`  | Deploy preview build (requires auth setup)      |
| `pnpm deploy:prod`     | Deploy to production (requires auth setup)      |
| `pnpm deploy:preview:ci` | CI-optimized preview deploy with JSON output  |
| `pnpm deploy:prod:ci`  | CI-optimized production deploy with JSON output |

#### Local Development Deployment

For local deployment testing:

1. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   export NETLIFY_SITE_ID="your_site_id_here"
   ```

2. **Verify authentication:**
   ```bash
   netlify status
   ```

3. **Deploy preview:**
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   pnpm deploy:preview
   ```

#### CI/CD Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
- Verifies Netlify credentials are properly configured
- Builds the site with production optimizations
- Deploys to Netlify using token-based authentication
- Runs post-deployment health checks
- Reports deployment status and URLs

## ‚úçÔ∏è Creating Blog Content

### Quick Start for Content Creators

Our blog uses Astro content collections with **colocated images** - each blog post has its own directory containing both content and images.

**Basic Structure:**
```
src/content/posts/your-post-slug/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.mdx        # Your blog post
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cover.png        # Cover image (required)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ diagram.png      # Any inline images
```

**Creating a New Post:**

1. **Create directory:** `mkdir src/content/posts/your-post-slug`
2. **Add cover image:** Place `cover.png` (800x450px recommended) in the directory
3. **Create content:** Add `index.mdx` with proper frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2024-01-15
description: "SEO-friendly description"
cover: ./cover.png
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["javascript", "tutorial"]
categories: ["Web Development"]
---
```

4. **Reference images in content:**
```mdx
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import diagram from './diagram.png';

<Image src={diagram} alt="Helpful description" width={600} height={400} />
```
