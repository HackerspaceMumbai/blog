## ‚úçÔ∏è Creating Blog Content

### Quick Start for Content Creators

Our blog uses Astro content collections with **colocated images** - each blog post has its own directory containing both content and images.

**Basic Structure:**
```
src/content/posts/your-post-slug/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.mdx        # Your blog post
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cover.png        # Cover image (required)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ diagram.png      # Any inline images
```

**Creating a New Post:**

1. **Create directory:** `mkdir src/content/posts/your-post-slug`
2. **Add cover image:** Place `cover.png` (800x450px recommended) in the directory
3. **Create content:** Add `index.mdx` with proper frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2024-01-15
description: "SEO-friendly description"
cover: ./cover.png
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["javascript", "tutorial"]
categories: ["Web Development"]
---
```

4. **Reference images in content:**
```mdx
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import diagram from './diagram.png';

<Image src={diagram} alt="Helpful description" width={600} height={400} />
```
