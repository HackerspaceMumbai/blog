## üìù Content Creation Guide

### Creating Blog Posts with Colocated Images

Our blog system uses Astro content collections with colocated images, meaning each blog post has its own directory containing both the content and all associated images.

#### Directory Structure

Each blog post should be organized as follows:

```
src/content/posts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your-post-slug/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.mdx              # Main blog post content
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cover.png              # Cover image (required)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ diagram-1.png          # Inline images
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshot-2.jpg       # More inline images
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                    # Any other assets
```

#### Step-by-Step: Creating a New Blog Post

1. **Create the post directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir src/content/posts/your-post-slug
   ```

2. **Add your cover image**
   - Place your cover image in the directory
   - Name it `cover.png`, `cover.jpg`, or `cover.webp`
   - Recommended size: 800x450px (16:9 aspect ratio)

3. **Create the index.mdx file**
   ```bash
   touch src/content/posts/your-post-slug/index.mdx
   ```

4. **Add frontmatter and content** (see examples below)

#### Frontmatter Example

```yaml
---
title: "Your Amazing Blog Post Title"
date: 2024-01-15
description: "A compelling description that will appear in search results and social media previews"
cover: ./cover.png                    # Relative path to your cover image
author: "Your Name"
tags:
  - javascript
  - astro
  - tutorial
categories: ["Web Development"]
---
```

#### Referencing Images in Content

**For inline images, use Astro's Image component:**

```mdx
---
title: "My Post"
# ... other frontmatter
---

import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import setupDiagram from './setup-diagram.png';
import resultScreenshot from './result-screenshot.jpg';

## Setup Process

Here's how to set up the project:

<Image 
  src={setupDiagram} 
  alt="Setup process diagram showing the three main steps" 
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

## Results

After following the steps, you should see:

<Image 
  src={resultScreenshot} 
  alt="Screenshot showing the successful setup with green checkmarks" 
  width={800}
  height={450}
/>
```

#### Image Guidelines

**Cover Images:**
- **Size:** 800x450px (16:9 aspect ratio) recommended
- **Format:** PNG, JPG, or WebP
- **File size:** Keep under 500KB for optimal performance
- **Naming:** Use `cover.png`, `cover.jpg`, or `cover.webp`

**Inline Images:**
- **Descriptive names:** Use kebab-case (e.g., `user-dashboard-screenshot.png`)
- **Alt text:** Always provide meaningful alt text for accessibility
- **Size:** Optimize for web (usually under 200KB per image)
- **Format:** PNG for screenshots/diagrams, JPG for photos

#### Complete Example

Here's a complete example of a blog post structure:

```
src/content/posts/getting-started-with-astro/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.mdx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cover.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ astro-logo.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-structure.png
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ final-result.jpg
```

**index.mdx:**
```mdx

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Images Not Loading

**Problem:** Images appear broken or don't load in development/production.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check file paths:** Ensure image imports use `./` for relative paths
   ```mdx
   import myImage from './my-image.png';  ‚úÖ Correct
   import myImage from 'my-image.png';    ‚ùå Incorrect
   ```

2. **Verify file names:** Ensure imported names match actual filenames
   ```mdx
   import setupDiagram from './setup-diagram.png';  ‚úÖ File exists
   import setupDiagram from './setup_diagram.png';  ‚ùå Wrong filename
   ```

3. **Check image formats:** Use supported formats (PNG, JPG, WebP, SVG)

### Cover Image Not Displaying

**Problem:** Cover image doesn't appear on blog cards or post headers.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check frontmatter path:**
   ```yaml
   cover: ./cover.png  ‚úÖ Correct relative path
   cover: cover.png    ‚ùå Missing ./
   ```

2. **Verify file exists:** Ensure the cover image file is in the post directory

3. **Check file extension:** Make sure the extension in frontmatter matches the actual file

### Build Errors

**Problem:** Build fails with image-related errors.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check for missing images:** Ensure all imported images exist
2. **Verify import syntax:** Use proper ES6 import syntax
3. **Check file permissions:** Ensure image files are readable

### TypeScript Errors

**Problem:** TypeScript complains about image imports.

**Solutions:**
1. **Use proper typing:** Import images as shown in examples
2. **Check astro.config.mjs:** Ensure image integration is properly configured

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Images are too large or slow to load.

**Solutions:**
1. **Optimize image sizes:** Keep images under recommended file sizes
2. **Use appropriate formats:** PNG for graphics, JPG for photos
3. **Leverage Astro's optimization:** Let Astro handle WebP conversion and sizing
